## Usage

The first page you should be greeted with is a login page, If you're not signed in yet you can click the signup button to create an account. Then you will be redirected to the main page which will be a page of local accounts uploading photo's which will be cards that you can click on. There will be a share link to upload your own art which will render a page that has an input form for uploading your own image. Otherwise when you click on one of the cards on screen it will bring you to a specific artworks page with more detail about that artwork. There is a comment section that will allow you to make, edit, and delete them as you please. Then there was a button on the home page that will be for our historical art section. Everytime you go to that page it should select a random artwork from the API we have chose to use and display some information about it.
